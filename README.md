The following project uses HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, bootstrap, sql, and PHP. 

It'll have a log-in and log-out feature where users will create a simple account that will give them the ability to 
create and delete 'posts' about their favorite schools among the list of schools available.

In the process of creating clean code, this project will utilize techniques ranging from breakpoints, mixins, 
css variables, and other css selectors.

I also added the SonarLint extension to test out its functionality.
